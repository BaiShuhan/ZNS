# ZNS (Zoned Namespaces SSD)

<p align = "justify"> 
Zoned Namespace (ZNS) SSDs represent a new division of functionality between host software and flash-based SSDs. A ZNS SSD groups its capacity into zones, where each zone can be read in any order but must be written sequentially. These characteristics allow a ZNS SSD to improve its internal data placement and thus lead to higher performance through higher write throughput, lower QoS, and increased capacity.

ZNS SSDs implement the NVMe ZNS Command Set specification as defined by the NVM Express (NVMe) organization and released as part of the NVMe 2.0 specifications. The latest revision available is 1.1.

## What did I do?

1. Study and explore the basic knowledge of ZNS: structure, working principle, performance metrics and design indexes;
2. Think about how ZNS and ISC can be effectively combined.
